The ``5-text_indentation`` module
==============================

Using ``text_indentation``
First import ``text_indentation`` from the ``5-text_indentation`` module

    >>> text_indentation = __import__('5-text_indentation').text_indentation

The function takes one argument, text
The text prints two new lines after each occurrence of '.', '?' or ':'

    >>> text_indentation("Bruh. What did he say?")
    Bruh.
    <BLANKLINE>
    What did he say?
    <BLANKLINE>
    >>> text_indentation("Bruh: What did he say? I didn't hear him well.")
    Bruh:
    <BLANKLINE>
    What did he say?
    <BLANKLINE>
    I didn't hear him well.
    <BLANKLINE>

    >>> text_indentation('No new line')
    No new line

Passing value types other than string would cause the function to fail

    >>> text_indentation()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: text must be a string

    >>> text_indentation(None)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: text must be a string
