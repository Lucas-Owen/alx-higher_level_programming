The ``2-matrix_divided`` module
==============================

Using ``matrix_divided``
First import ``matrix_divided`` from the ``2-matrix_divided`` module

    >>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

The function takes in two arguments, the first is the matrix, the second is the divider
It divides all elements of the matrix with the divider
It returns a new matrix each element rounded to two decimal places
It should work fine on a matrix of ints or floats

    >>> matrix_divided([[1, 2, 3], [4.0, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9.0]], 3)
    [[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0], [2.33, 2.67, 3.0]]

Passing any other value types would cause the function to fail
When matrix is not a valid matrix of numbers, a TypeError is thrown with an error message

    >>> matrix_divided([[1, 2]])
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

    >>> matrix_divided()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

    >>> matrix_divided(None, 4)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

    >>> matrix_divided([], 4)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

    >>> matrix_divided([[1, 2, 'three']], 4)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

    >>> matrix_divided([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8]], 4)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

The divider should also be a number, passing any other value would cause the function to throw a TypeError

    >>> matrix_divided([[2, 4], [6, 8]], None)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: div must be a number

When div is 0, a ZeroDivisionError is thrown

    >>> matrix_divided([[2, 4], [6, 8]], 0)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
