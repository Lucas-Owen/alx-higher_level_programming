The ``4-print_square`` module
==============================

Using ``print_square``
First import ``print_square`` from the ``4-print_square`` module

    >>> print_square = __import__('4-print_square').print_square

The function takes one argument, size, which is the length of the square to be printed

    >>> print_square(4)
    ####
    ####
    ####
    ####

When the length is zero, nothing is printed

    >>> print_square(0)

Passing value types other than int would cause the function to fail

    >>> print_square()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: size must be an integer

    >>> print_square(None)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: size must be an integer

Passing negative values would also cause the function to fail

    >>> print_square(-1)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ValueError: size must be >= 0
